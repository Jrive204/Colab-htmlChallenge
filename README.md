# CoLab Challenge: User Interface and Git

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Challenge.**

## Introduction

In this challenge, you are taking over a project from a co-worker. His task was to build the website for a client(Lambda). You will create a missing header (navigation and image) on the home page, update some CSS styling on the home page, and make your page responsive for mobile. Working with a pre-existing web page will allow you to understand what it is like to inherit code from someone else; this is regularly happening on the job.

In meeting the minimum viable product (MVP) specifications listed below, your web page should look like the solution screen shots of the home page and mobile version.

## Instructions

### Task 1: Project Set Up

- [ ] Create a forked copy of this project
- [ ] Add your team lead(Jrive204) as collaborator on Github
- [ ] Clone your OWN version of the repository
- [ ] Create a new branch: git checkout -b `<firstName-lastName>`.
- [ ] Implement the project on your newly created `<firstName-lastName>` branch, committing changes regularly
- [ ] Push commits: git push origin `<firstName-lastName>`

### Task 2: Minimum Viable Product

Your finished project must include all of the following requirements:

#### Home Page

[Review the provided design files](/design). Notice the navigation and header images are missing in the starter code.

- [ ] Build the HTML and CSS to create the missing navigation and header
- [ ] Link the `About` navigation item to an about.html page (you'll also need to create `about.html`)
- [ ] Make your design responsive such that it is accessible on mobile(500px)and matches the [mobile](design/home/Mobile.png) wireframe.
- [ ] Add responsive breakpoints to your code by using media queries

You will also notice there are 10 boxes on the home page that need background colors. Use this list below to correctly style each box:

- [ ] box1: `teal`
- [ ] box2: `gold`
- [ ] box3: `cadetblue`
- [ ] box4: `coral`
- [ ] box5: `crimson`
- [ ] box6: `forestgreen`
- [ ] box7: `darkorchid`
- [ ] box8: `hotpink`
- [ ] box9: `indigo`
- [ ] box10: `dodgerblue`

In your solution, it is essential that you follow best practices and produce clean and professional results. Schedule time to review, refine, and assess your work and perform basic professional polishing including spell-checking and grammar-checking on your work. It is better to submit a challenge that meets MVP than one that attempts too much and does not.

### Task 3: Stretch Problems

After finishing MVP, you can push your work further.

- [ ] Make your design responsive such that it is accessible on tablet(800 px) and matches the [tablet](design/home/Tablet.png) wireframe.
- [ ] Build the about page based on the design your UX developer has provided. [Review the provided design files](/design)
- [ ] Build a page of your choosing from the navigation items. Come up with content and images that fit the theme.
- [ ] Introduce CSS animations to your site.
- [ ] Build a contact page and create a form with several inputs of your choosing (Doesn't need to submit)
